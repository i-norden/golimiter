# golimiter

A leaky-bucket based net/http limiter that can implement whitelisting,
blacklisting, and enforce different rate limitations in response
to changes in overall api demand

Still a work in progress <br />
Needs to be properly tested and benchmarked

## Install

go get github.com/i-norden/golimiter

## Usage

```
import "github.com/i-norden/golimiter"
```

**Instantiate a new limiter object and set desired parameters:**
```
# The below creates a limiter that applies a whitelist and allows permitted
# users 1 api call per second with burst up to 6 per second

lim := golimiter.Limiter{}
lim.Rate = 1                                        # rate at which bucket refills (per second)
lim.Burst = 6                                       # size of the bucket
lim.Whitelist.On = true                             # turn whitelisting on
lim.Whitelist.Filename = "./whitelist_filename"     # whitelist location
lim.Whitelist.UpdateFreq = 5                        # whitelist read frequency (in minutes)
```

**Initiate the limiter's processes:**

```
err := lim.Init()
```

**And wrap its LimitHTTPHandler method around an http.Handler:**

```
http.ListenAndServe(":443", lim.LimitHTTPHandler(http.HandlerFunc(yourHandlerFunc)))
```

**Or its LimitHTTPFunc method around an http handler function:**

```
http.ListenAndServe(":443", lim.LimitHTTPFunc(yourHandlerFunc))

# In both above cases, yourHandlerFunc is of type func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
```

**Or use LimitNetConn to limit a lower level net connection:**

```
ln, _ := net.Listen(CONN_TYPE, CONN_HOST+":"+CONN_PORT)
conn, _ := ln.Accept()
go lim.LimitNetConn(conn, yourHandlerFunc)

# In this case, yourHandlerFunc is of the type: func(conn net.Conn)
```
**In attempt to adjust for changes in global api demand you can** <br />
**add global request thresholds to the limiter and define new rate** <br />
**restrictions to be enforced when these thresholds are surpassed**

```
# The below adds a load threshold to the limiter of 5000 per second by
# creating a leaky bucket with a size of 5000 that refills at a rate of 5000
# per second and is drained by all incoming requests handled by the limiter
# When this shared bucket is depleted it causes incoming requests to be
# limited using new, lower rate and burst sizes (0.5 and 3 instead of 1 and 6)

lim.AddState(0, 5000, 3, 10)

# You can add as many states as you like, but be sure to specify
# their ordering using the first (int) argument to the AddState method
# When multiple thresholds are simultaneously surpassed
# the highest order limiter state becomes the active one

lim.AddState(1, 10000, 1, 5)
lim.AddState(2, 20000, 0.5, 2)
```

Note that white/blacklist files currently need to be in the form
of a newline ("\n") delimitated list of the IP address strings

Also note that the white/blacklists and the list of visitors with their
associated limiters are internal to their limiter so distinct limiter
objects will enforce their limitations completely independent of one
another. So you can reuse the same limiter on different handler functions
if you want to enforce shared api limitations across all of them or instantiate
different limiters to impose separate limitations on each handler
